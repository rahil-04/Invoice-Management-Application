# 🌐 AI-Enabled FinTech B2B Invoice Management Application

## 📇 Description
This project implements an AI-enabled FinTech B2B Invoice Management System, leveraging Machine Learning (ML), React, and JDBC Servlets. The application aims to streamline the invoicing process between businesses, enhancing cash flow management and improving the efficiency of accounts receivable departments.

## 🗒️ Introduction to B2B Operations
In the B2B environment, businesses transact with one another on credit. Upon ordering goods, the seller issues an invoice detailing the purchased items and the payment terms, which is crucial for managing "Accounts Receivable."

- Collecting payments for past due invoices
- Sending reminders and follow-ups to customers
- Managing the overall cash inflow process
- Ensuring that services and products rendered are compensated

This project aims to address these challenges by building a machine learning model that predicts the payment date of invoices when they are created, alongside a full-stack invoice management application.

## 🔥 Features

- Machine Learning Model to predict the payment date of an invoice when it gets created in the system.
- A Receivables Dashboard to visualize data in the form of grids.
- ADD, EDIT and DELETE functionalities.
